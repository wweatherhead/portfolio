                <p class="portfolio-description">
                    This map was my first step in designing maps specifically for the web, as well as exploring the bivariate system of cartographic design. While working for the university in the summer of 2024, I heard stories about the mass outbreak of cicadas to the south. After a little digging, I found out about their genus, Magicicada, as well as their cycles. As a lover of nature and former ecology major, I knew I had stumbled upon something special that I desperately wanted to map. Finding data for cicada populations was rather simple thanks to INaturalist's logs of user submitted sightings. However, in order to construct the bivariate map, I would need a second dataset to compare it to. I decided to run with crop indemnity after a family member asked me whether or not the cicadas damage crops, as if anybody would know the answer it would be the insurance people. The result of these two datasets is the bivariate map displayed above. This ArcStorymap was a true passion project as I merged my two loves, cartography and ecology, together into a single project. With this proof of concept produced, I am excited to discover using maps to tell ecological stories.
