                    This map was my final project for my first cartopgraphy class, the class the got me interested in cartography and geography in the first place. Growing up in Florida on the Gulf Stream, the ocean was always by my side. I was raised playing in the sand, splashing in the water, and disovering new types of fish from the fishermen that would line the beaches. Something that always vexed me was how the oceans worked, and how the Gulf of Mexico was always warm and flush with life. As I grew older, I came to understand the complexities of ocean currents and how they drive weather, as well as shape the environments of the landmasses they come into contact with. As I became a cartographer, I knew I had to visualize this phenomenon and showcase how the planet is interconnected through the oceans and their currents. To do this, I used the Spilhaus projection to give an ocean-centric view and blacked out all of the continents to give focus soley to the ocean. The mapping for this project was started in ArcGIS pro and finished in Adobe Illustrator.
